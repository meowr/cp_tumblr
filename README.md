# Week 4 Project - Tumblr

This is an interactive prototype of the Tumblr iPhone app.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

* [x] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
* [x] Compose button modally presents the compose screen.
* [x] Optional: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
* [x] Optional: Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
* [x] Optional: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.

Note: I couldn't get the custom modal transition to work, so used the cross-fade option instead.
